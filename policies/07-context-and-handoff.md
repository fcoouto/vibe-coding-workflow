# Context and Handoff

Apply with the [shared contract rules](00-index.md).

**Mandatory adoption.** Keep decisions, instructions and continuation records accurate, discoverable and proportionate to the task.

**Project Onboarding:** map canonical documents, directory instructions, client-specific loading and actual memory locations. Reuse working records and supported client mechanisms; verify discovery and retrieval where observable.

| Element | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger | When starting or resuming a task; when behavior, commands, schema, boundaries, configuration or material decisions change; before handing off unfinished work. |
| Decision | Identify the authoritative record, relevant context and evidence needed now. Separate durable knowledge from temporary progress, observations from assumptions, and current decisions from superseded ones. |
| Required action | Retrieve applicable records, reconcile them against actual state, and update the responsible document alongside the change. Preserve enough verified context to continue without copying entire conversations or maintaining competing instructions. |
| Evidence | Record canonical paths and loading mechanisms; durable facts include their source, scope, last verification and invalidation trigger. Task records distinguish actual checks, pending work and unavailable observations. |
| Blocking condition | Missing, contradictory or stale information that materially affects scope or correctness blocks dependent decisions. Apply [Project Scope](01-project-scope.md) to unresolved authority; continue independent authorized work. |

## Canonical documents and selective retrieval

- Map existing equivalents for the overview, product scope, shared/client instructions, architecture, interface design, onboarding, quality and setup. Preserve useful directory rules and established filenames. Check case-insensitive collisions before consolidating files; preserve useful content and update references rather than create parallel authorities.
- Keep shared entry instructions short: actual commands, essential constraints and links with clear loading triggers. Client-specific files reference shared rules through supported mechanisms and retain only necessary client details. Load relevant details and tools on demand.
- After verifying an invocation repair, fix the owning command/configuration or instruction so later tasks use it. Retain its scope, evidence and invalidation conditions in the existing responsible record; a separate lesson does not repair a still-faulty invocation. Reuse existing prerequisite and retry controls before adding failure storage.
- Update the document that owns the changed behavior, decision or command. Keep complex plans discoverable with evidence, outstanding issues and next action. Describe planned or unavailable capabilities honestly; a written preference does not prove installation or execution.
- Prefer native memory and existing versioned documents. Add an external knowledge store only for a concrete need and authorized destination; do not create a vault, server or export merely to complete a checklist.
- Recheck memory against current code and authoritative decisions. Update or retire superseded entries, retaining useful decision history without leaving obsolete instructions active. Verify retrieval in a clean context when observable; a file's presence alone is not retrieval evidence.
- Keep credentials, personal data, sensitive traces and unnecessary transcripts out of shared records. Store necessary private evidence in an appropriate restricted location; share sanitized summaries. A graph or index may be incomplete or stale: state coverage limits rather than invent relationships.

## Lifecycle record and reports

Use the existing task context or plan for starts, meaningful checkpoints, completion and unfinished work. Keep standing context once; update changes using short prose or this optional layout, omitting irrelevant headings:

- **Assignment:** objective, authorized scope, acceptance criteria and standing constraints.
- **Result and proof:** current result/phase, exact candidate and relevant paths, actual checks/results and evidence references. Distinguish planned, observed, reviewable and accepted.
- **Material exceptions:** findings, limits, unknowns, pending work and blockers; changed permissions, remaining budgets, dependencies, owned resources, process state and recovery when relevant. Distinguish stopped, running and unknown workers/processes; claim background work only when active execution is verified.
- **Next:** necessary next action and its owner, including the condition for resuming blocked work.

A child report sends this record's changed result, snapshot-bound candidate/proof references when output changes, material exceptions and necessary next action/owner. Reuse known assignment context, saved role declarations and native sender identity; supply compact context when the receiver cannot resolve it after resume or reassignment. Reports grant no authority and replace neither independent verification nor required decision-time observations of readiness, permissions, liveness and ownership.

Report reviewable output, material blockers/decisions and changed dependency/ownership conditions. Start normally updates local state without acknowledgment. Omit unchanged progress, heartbeat/acknowledgment loops, repeated roles/instructions, routine title receipts, reasoning and raw logs. Retrieve detail for acceptance, recovery or diagnosis; brevity must not hide material risk. The coordinator records receipt during existing handling without a required reply turn, then applies [delivery, supervision and acceptance](03-agent-delegation.md#progress-and-result-retrieval).

At applicable starts, checkpoints and completion, follow the existing [Thread Naming owner](../clients/workstreams-naming.md), including eligibility, overrides, pauses and pending-write recovery. Keep actual readback or a truthful preserved/pending/unavailable outcome in existing presentation metadata. Report only decision-relevant display exceptions; display failure remains nonblocking. A turn ending or child report never implies `DONE`: child output awaits parent acceptance; root completion includes the full agreed deliverable and required integration. Add no model turns solely for acknowledgments or title repair.

For example, when the assignment and sender are already known:

> Reviewable: `src/cleaning.py`, candidate `abc123`; linked `checks.txt` records `python3 -B check.py` passed on that snapshot. Independent review pending. Next: coordinator reviews; child retains ownership.

This optional layout adds no required artifact or status store and replaces no policy, machine request or continuation contract.

## Handoff and resumption

Use the [lifecycle record](#lifecycle-record-and-reports) for unfinished work.
On resume, inspect the actual checkout, files, checks and processes before trusting the handoff. Reconcile discrepancies and use [Agent Delegation](03-agent-delegation.md) before taking over uncertain worker resources. Preserve pauses and limits; continue only the authorized remainder. Keep temporary progress out of permanent memory. Durable lessons belong once in the responsible record, supported by evidence and a condition for rechecking them.

Selected managed delivery also loads the [continuation protocol](../clients/workstreams-protocol.md). Reconcile writers and review readers before resuming; preserve identity, original scope, pins and remaining budgets.
