# Review my Project procedure

## Scope and selection

Honor repositories, areas, Full Scan choices, and exact separate approvals already in the request or current task. Ask only for a missing choice. If the target or repository list is ambiguous, clarify that boundary before inspecting. When selection is needed, identify repositories first, use native multi-select when available or a numbered/text list otherwise, then select areas. Preserve both choices; do not widen a subset into an umbrella review.

For project authority and applicable instructions, follow [Project Scope](../../../policies/01-project-scope.md).

Use a successfully resolved, current canonical membership for an enrolled Project and review each selected Repository under its own checkout, instructions, evidence, and actual working directory. If enrollment is known but canonical membership or qualification is unavailable, preserve that known enrollment state; do not relabel members as temporary or infer umbrella membership. Continue only with repositories the user explicitly selected, name the unresolved membership/retention limit, and do not claim full umbrella coverage. An explicitly unenrolled standalone or umbrella request is temporary review scope: use only named repositories, with no enrollment, standing join authority, or future auto-joining.

Select one or more areas:

- **Code quality:** ordinary lint, file size, duplication, responsibility, and maintainability. Detailed source-structure or agent-context assessment needs matching explicit approval for the repositories, candidates, and analysis, even under Full Scan. Load [the focused assessment procedure](source-structure.md) only with that approval; Full Scan alone never starts it.
- **Correctness and tests:** bugs, edge cases, missing important tests, and existing test/build evidence.
- **Security and dependencies:** relevant risks and dependency findings supported by available inspection or tools.
- **Architecture and performance:** boundaries, complexity, evidence-backed risks, and measured findings where available.

**Full Scan** means all applicable areas only within the selected repositories, at a stated bounded depth with exclusions and gaps. It never includes workflow health or context/token efficiency diagnostics. Do not imply exhaustive assurance.

## Inspect and check safely

Read each repository's applicable project and directory instructions first. Project rules and accepted local decisions govern; absent standards become recommendations, not invented requirements. Keep repository checks, evidence, and findings separate even when one user request covers several repositories.

Use existing relevant evidence and project tooling when available. If a task has applicable Codex check/review evidence, read [Task checks and review evidence](../../../clients/evidence.md) for its freshness and limits. Before running a project command, identify its actual definition and inspect its effects. Use only understood, safe local commands at the selected Repository's real checkout cwd; do not run Actions or Superset workflows, contact production/network services, run migrations, or run commands that modify source/configuration or cause unrelated persistent effects. Use disposable outputs only when their isolation and cleanup are clear. If effects or isolation are uncertain, skip execution, record the gap, and continue independent inspection. For command selection and safety, follow [Tests and Builds](../../../policies/05-tests-and-builds.md); for a selected security review, also follow [Security Review](../../../policies/04-security-review.md); for a requested change review, follow [Code Review](../../../policies/06-code-review.md). Do not turn this review into onboarding or enrollment.

Run each canonical local command once for unchanged inputs and share its result across selected areas. Re-run only commands affected by relevant changes. Do not duplicate a file-size check already covered by lint. Reuse a result only when its candidate, command definition, environment, and policy remain current. Label evidence as inspected, executed, reused, unavailable, or unverified; missing evidence is not a pass.

Use an installed review capability only when it fits the selected scope and is authorized. Reuse existing review facilities; do not build another audit engine or install a tool merely to fill a checklist.

## Installations and fixes

Review approval permits inspection only. If a missing tool would materially help, name the package/tool, purpose, installation scope, and affected files including manifests and lockfiles. Install only after explicit approval for that exact package and scope; reuse a matching approval already recorded for this task without asking again. A declined or unavailable installation remains a coverage gap.

Do not modify project content during review. Report the smallest useful fix and affected scope for each finding. Apply a fix only after separate explicit approval for that selected fix and scope; reuse an exact prior approval without asking again. Installation approval never approves a fix, and scan approval never approves either. Carry out approved changes through the project's ordinary workflow and checks; do not expand them to unrelated files.

Approval for focused analysis permits inspection and reporting only. Accepting its findings does not authorize refactoring; obtain separate explicit approval for each selected change and use the normal development workflow.

## Findings, report, and retention

For each finding provide supporting evidence and location, impact, confidence, smallest useful fix, and effort. Distinguish confirmed findings, hypotheses, and recommendations. State what was inspected, executed, reused, and left unverified, along with freshness, exclusions, and remaining limits. Do not invent measurements or claim assurance beyond the evidence.

Owner resolution now supports ordinary Repository and explicitly selected temporary Project accounting, plus read-only enrolled accounting; see [private owner accounting](../../prepare-my-workspace/references/private-storage.md) only when the user explicitly requests owner accounting. This does not complete managed detailed-report retention, Project caps, temporary-export semantics, or D10 integration. Until those requirements and reconciliation are complete, do not save a new detailed plugin report or review artifact. Return bounded, appropriately redacted findings in chat and disclose that plugin retention cannot yet be enforced. Preserve the existing report, installation, analysis, and refactoring approval boundaries. Unsupported overlap or history remains protected; unknown history grants no allowance and no reset or replacement owner. Do not create another store, quota, allowance, or registry as a workaround. Native client history is outside plugin retention; never claim it was erased or managed.

Finish with the requested scope's findings, evidence and coverage limits, and the next useful action. A clean result means no issue was substantiated in the inspected scope; it does not mean the project is secure or exhaustive.
